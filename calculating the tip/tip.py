'''
Let's create a function total_calc() that helps us calculate and 
print out the total amount paid at a restaurant. Given a bill amount and the percentage
 of the bill amount you decide to pay us a tip (tip_perc ),
 this function calculates the total amount you should pay.
'''

def total_calc(bill_amount,tip_perc):
    total=bill_amount*(1+0.01*tip_perc)
    total=round(total,2)
    print('please pay ',total)
total_calc(150,20)
