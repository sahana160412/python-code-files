"""Write a program to calculate the electricity bill.
 The bill is calculated by checking the number of units consumed. 
 Suppose the user is consuming less than 50 units. 
 The per-unit cost will be 2.60, and the tax on that bill will be 25. 
 If a user is consuming more than 50 but less than 100. 
 Then the per-unit cost will be 3.25, and the tax on that bill will be 35 
 If the user is coming more than
   100 and less than 200.
     Then the per-unit cost will be 5.26, and the tax will be 45 And above 200,
       the cost of the unit is 8.45, and the tax is 75.
